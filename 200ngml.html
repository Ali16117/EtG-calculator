<h1>What Does 200 ng/mL Mean?</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When you undergo an EtG test to check for alcohol use, you might come across results expressed in terms of nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). A common value you might see is 200 ng/mL. Let's break down what this means for you.</p>

<h2>What is EtG?</h2>
<p>Firstly, EtG is a metabolite produced by your liver when it processes alcohol. The presence of EtG in your urine is a sign that you've consumed alcohol.</p>

<h3>Interpreting 200 ng/mL</h3>
<p>If your EtG test shows a level of 200 ng/mL, it indicates a relatively low level of this metabolite in your urine. This could mean a few things:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Light Drinking:</strong> You may have had a small amount of alcohol.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Factor:</strong> A significant amount of time might have passed since you drank alcohol.</li>
    <li><strong>Incidental Exposure:</strong> You could have been exposed to products containing alcohol, like mouthwash or hand sanitizer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What It Doesn't Tell:</h3>
<p>It's crucial to understand that 200 ng/mL doesn't tell us how much alcohol you consumed, the type of alcohol, or when you consumed it. The test is not a measure of intoxication level.</p>

<h3>Factors Influencing Results:</h3>
<p>Several factors can affect your EtG levels, including your body's metabolism, hydration levels, and even your age and overall health.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A 200 ng/mL result in an EtG test is relatively low but still significant for detecting alcohol use. It's important to discuss your results with your healthcare provider for an accurate interpretation, especially if you are in a program where alcohol abstinence is required or monitored.</p>
