        <h1>What Does 150 ng/mL Mean?</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>An EtG test result of 150 ng/mL is a relatively low level, but it's higher than the minimal detection threshold. This level can provide insights into recent alcohol use.</p>

        <h2>What is EtG?</h2>
        <p>EtG, or ethyl glucuronide, is a metabolite that forms when the body processes alcohol. Its presence in urine is a reliable indicator of alcohol consumption in the recent past.</p>

        <h3>Interpreting 150 ng/mL</h3>
        <p>At a level of 150 ng/mL, the EtG test suggests a slight increase in alcohol exposure. This may indicate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recent Light Drinking:</strong> This level can be associated with recent, but not heavy, alcohol consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Decreasing Levels:</strong> It could also indicate that alcohol was consumed a few days ago, and the levels are declining.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What It Doesn't Tell:</h3>
        <p>A result of 150 ng/mL does not specify the exact amount of alcohol consumed or the precise time of drinking. It is not a direct measure of intoxication or impairment.</p>

        <h3>Factors Influencing Results:</h3>
        <p>EtG levels can be affected by individual factors like the body's metabolic rate, hydration, and overall health condition.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>A 150 ng/mL EtG test result is indicative of some level of alcohol exposure. Understanding the context and individual factors is key to interpreting this result accurately. Consultation with a healthcare provider is advised for a comprehensive assessment.</p>
